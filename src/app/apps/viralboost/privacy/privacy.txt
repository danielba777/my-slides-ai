# **Privacy Policy**

**Last updated April 2, 2025**

This privacy notice for **A&B Business** (doing business as **ViralBoost**) describes how and why we collect, store, use, and/or process your information when you use our services. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use our Services.
If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at **[info@slidescockpit.com](mailto:info@slidescockpit.com)**.

## **1. What information do we collect?**

### **Personal information you disclose to us**

Using ViralBoost is generally possible without providing personal data. If personal data (such as name, address, or email address) is collected, it is done voluntarily whenever possible. We do not share this data with third parties without your explicit consent.

If a contractual relationship is established, modified, or requested, or if you send an inquiry, we collect and use the personal data required to respond (inventory data).
We also collect, process, and use personal data necessary to enable the use of the service (usage data).

Personal data is stored only as long as necessary for its purpose (processing requests or handling contracts), taking legal retention periods into account.

We may be obligated to share data with authorities in specific cases, for example for criminal prosecution, hazard prevention, legal obligations of constitutional protection authorities, the Military Counterintelligence Service, or enforcement of intellectual property rights.

We point out that Internet data transmission (e.g., email communication) can have security vulnerabilities, and complete protection against third-party access is not possible.

The use of contact data published due to imprint obligations for sending unsolicited advertising is prohibited unless an existing business relationship or explicit consent exists.
A&B Business and any third parties mentioned on this website reserve the right to take legal action against unsolicited advertising.
